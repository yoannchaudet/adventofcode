I like puzzle and I am probably very rusty ðŸ§ .

Trying the 2020 https://adventofcode.com.

## Day-01

For that day, I am using PowerShell 7.1:

``` ps
# Part 1
./day-01/fix-accounting.ps1 ./day-01/input.txt

# Part 2
./day-01/fix-accounting.ps1 ./day-01/input.txt -Part2
```

## Day-02

Same thing:

``` ps
# Part 1
./day-02/validate-passwords.ps1 ./day-02/input.txt

# Part 2
./day-02/validate-passwords.ps1 ./day-02/input.txt -Part2
```

## Day-03

Again:

``` ps
# Part 1
./day-03/how-many-trees.ps1 ./day-03/input.txt
```
